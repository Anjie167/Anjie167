## Projects and Contributions

Throughout my journey as a developer, I have worked on several projects and contributed to various open-source repositories. I believe in the power of collaboration and the impact it can have on the development community.

I have published two Medium posts that dive into the seamless transition from Flutter to React, introducing a package that provides familiar widget styles and on Flutteflow csv list import with Node.JS. You can find the posts here: [A Seamless Transition from Flutter to React: Introducing a Package for Familiar Widget-Style Layouts](https://medium.com/@anjie167/title-a-seamless-transition-from-flutter-to-react-introducing-a-package-for-familiar-widget-style-cfdae87b9b8e) and [Importing List Data from CSV into Firestore with Node.js: A Solution for the FlutterFlow Community](https://medium.com/@anjie167/title-importing-csv-data-into-firestore-with-node-js-a-solution-for-the-flutterflow-community-41497efdddd8).

I have also released an npm package called `@anjie167/flutter_components`, which includes a set of Flutter-inspired components for React developers. You can find the package here: [npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anjie167/flutter_components).

Additionally, I have created a Node.js code snippet that allows FlutterFlow developers to import a list of data from CSV to Firebase. This code snippet can greatly simplify the data import process and enhance the workflow. You can find the code snippet in my repositories.
